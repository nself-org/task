## Description

**ɳTasks** is a reference app in the nSelf ecosystem. The Flutter client connects to a self-hosted backend running PostgreSQL 16, Hasura GraphQL Engine, Hasura Auth, Hasura Storage, and MinIO, orchestrated under `backend/` by the nSelf CLI.

Like the other Type C reference apps (`nchat`, `nclaw`, `ntv`), ɳTasks uses the nSelf CLI as its backend entry point. `make up` delegates to `nself start`; `make down` delegates to `nself stop`.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nself-org/ntask.git my-tasks
cd my-tasks/backend
cp .env.example .env.dev   # customize secrets
nself build                # generate docker-compose.yml + nginx + SSL
nself start                # start the stack  (or: make up)
cd ../app && flutter run
```

The backend exposes Hasura at `http://localhost:8080`, Auth at `http://localhost:4000`, Storage at `http://localhost:8484`. The Flutter app picks the right target based on your build platform.

## Features

ɳTasks ships 35+ task-management capabilities (lists, tags, recurring tasks, sharing, real-time presence, calendar/today/overdue views, attachments, smart notifications, PWA install). The full inventory lives in the wiki:

- See the [Features wiki page](https://github.com/nself-org/task/wiki/Features) for the complete capability list with status, configuration, and usage notes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.7+ ([install guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install))
- nSelf CLI v1.0.9+ ([install guide](https://docs.nself.org/getting-started))
- Docker 20+ with Docker Compose v2
- GNU Make
- (Optional) Hasura CLI for migration management

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env.dev   # fill in project secrets
nself build                # generates docker-compose.yml, nginx config, SSL certs
nself start                # start the stack  (or: make up)
make health                # verify all services are healthy
```

Stop with `nself stop` (or `make down`). View logs with `make logs`. Open a Postgres shell with `make psql`.

### App Setup

```bash
cd app
flutter pub get
flutter run                # picks the connected device / desktop / web target
```

For platform-specific builds:

```bash
flutter build web          # produces build/web/
flutter build apk          # Android
flutter build ios          # iOS (macOS host required)
flutter build macos        # macOS desktop
flutter build linux        # Linux desktop
flutter build windows      # Windows desktop
```

## Usage

```bash
cd backend && nself start          # start backend (or: make up)
cd app && flutter run -d chrome    # run app in Chrome
```

```bash
cd backend && make migrate         # apply pending Hasura migrations
cd backend && make backup          # create a Postgres backup to ./backups/
cd backend && nself start --env staging   # bring up staging stack
```

```bash
cd app && flutter test                          # unit + widget tests
cd app && flutter test integration_test/        # integration tests
```

## Architecture

Flutter app talks to a Docker Compose backend (PostgreSQL 16, Hasura GraphQL Engine, Hasura Auth, Hasura Storage over MinIO, Mailpit for dev email, Traefik for staging/prod HTTPS). The app uses Hasura GraphQL as the only backend boundary; no direct Postgres access.

See the [Backend Architecture wiki page](https://github.com/nself-org/task/wiki/Backend-Architecture) for the full deep-dive.

## Platform Support

The app is Flutter and runs on:

| Target | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Web (PWA-capable) | Active | `flutter build web`, deployed via `web/task` to `task.nself.org` |
| macOS desktop | Active | `flutter build macos` |
| Linux desktop | Active | `flutter build linux` |
| Windows desktop | Active | `flutter build windows` |
| iOS | Building | Builds locally; not yet shipped to App Store |
| Android | Building | Builds locally; not yet shipped to Google Play |

There is no separate Swift, Kotlin, React Native, or Next.js frontend: Flutter is the only client codebase.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| App framework | Flutter 3.7+ (Dart) |
| App state | Riverpod 2.x |
| App local storage | Hive + flutter_secure_storage |
| App networking | `http` package (GraphQL over HTTP/WS) |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| GraphQL | Hasura GraphQL Engine |
| Auth | Hasura Auth (JWT) |
| Storage | Hasura Storage over MinIO (S3-compatible) |
| Dev email | Mailpit |
| HTTPS (staging/prod) | Traefik with Let's Encrypt |
| Orchestration | nSelf CLI + Docker Compose + Makefile |
